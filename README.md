## Description

Since I couldn't find a Rumble API to retrieve information 
about a particular rumble channel, I decided to build one.

This Rumble Channel API allows you to get useful data about
any existent rumble channel, such as:

- url 
- id
- banner image source
- avatar image source
- title
- number of followers
- about description
- rumble joining date
- number of videos uploaded
- videos data

... and more!

All you need to do is provide a valid URL of an existent rumble
channel, such as: https://rumble.com/c/TateSpeech
